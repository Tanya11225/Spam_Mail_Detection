📧 Spam Mail Detection






📌 Overview

This project is a Spam Mail Detection System built using Machine Learning. The model classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on their textual content.

It uses techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization and Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression for effective text classification.

🛠️ Features

✅ Preprocessing of email text (cleaning & tokenization)

✅ Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer

✅ Model training using ML algorithms

✅ Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score

✅ Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook
